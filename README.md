<h1>@CedrickLupembe</h1>

Hi, I'm Cedrickâ€”a Front-end web developer at Fyatu Inc. working on user interfaces. Previously worked at Fongo-laboratory. I help companies and organizations build modern, resilient, and inclusive Web user interfaces with a strong focus on responsive design, performance, and accessibility.

ðŸ’• I care about redistributing power, inclusive design, digital communities, and mindfulness.

<h2>How I work</h2>

My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (Hopefully) just enough process.
Checklists are my absolute favorite. :white_check_mark: if I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. :joy_cat:

<h2>Stack I'm working with</h2>

 ```javascript

const Stack = [ 

  { JavaScript(ES6), html(5), css(3) },
   
  { 'React', 'Next', 'Node.js', 'Express', 'Tailwind', 'Chakra UI', 'Styled Components', 'Sass'},
   
  { 'Git', 'Github', 'Netlify', 'Heroku', 'MongoDB' 'Vercel', 'AWS', 'Firebase', 'Webpack', 'Postman' },
   
  { 'Figma', 'Sketch', 'InVision', 'InDesign', 'Photoshop' }
  
]
